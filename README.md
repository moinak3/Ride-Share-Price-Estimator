# Ride-Share-Price-Estimator
This code sample takes lets users put in a source and destination in Mumbai, India and then gives you back a list of prices charged by all the different ride sharing partners, and tells you what would be the cheapest option.

This is still work in progress.

The code sample takes in the source and destination as input parameters and then finds the estimated distance and duration using Google Distance Matrix APIs, and then compares the pricing across all variants of Uber, Ola, Taxi for Sure, Meru, EasyCab, Genie, Kala-Peela and Autos and returns the cheapest option.

Please generate a key for Google Distance Matrix before running the sample.
